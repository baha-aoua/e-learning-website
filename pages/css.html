              <h5>1.1. Cascading Style Sheet</h5>
              <p>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the
                presentation of web pages. It provides web developers with a
                powerful set of tools for controlling the layout, typography,
                colors, and other visual aspects of a website, separate from its
                content.
              </p>
              <p>
                CSS works by defining styles for HTML elements using selectors,
                which specify which elements the styles should be applied to.
                CSS styles consist of properties and values, which define how
                the selected elements should be displayed.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="item-1-2">
              <h5>1.2. Syntax</h5>
              <p>
                The syntax of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is fairly
                straightforward. Here are the basic components of a CSS rule:
              </p>
              <p>
                Selector {<br />
                Property: Value;
                <br />}
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's what each part of the rule means:<br />

                <br />Selector: This is the HTML element that you want to style.
                You can select an element by its tag name (e.g. "p"), class name
                (e.g. ".my-class"), or ID (e.g. "#my-id").

                <br />Property: This is the specific style you want to apply to
                the selected element. Examples of properties include "color,"
                "font-size," "background-color," and "padding."

                <br />Value: This is the value you want to assign to the
                property. For example, if you want to set the font size to 14
                pixels, you would use "font-size: 14px;" as the property and
                value
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 4.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />It's important to note that CSS is a cascading language,
                which means that multiple styles can be applied to the same
                element, and the browser will determine which one to use based
                on a set of rules. These rules determine the specificity of the
                selector and the order in which the styles are applied.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="item-2">
              <h4>2. Genealogy and different types of selectors</h4>
            </div>

            <div id="item-2-1">
              <h5>2.1. Class Selectors</h5>
              <p>
                In CSS, a class selector is a way to target and style HTML
                elements based on their class attribute. Class selectors start
                with a dot (.) followed by the name of the class.
              </p>
              <p>
                To apply a class selector to an HTML element, you would add the
                class attribute to the element's HTML tag and assign it a name
                that matches the class selector in the CSS.
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 5.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />In this example, we've defined a class selector called
                ".my-class" that sets the text color to red and the font size to
                16 pixels. To apply this class to an HTML element, we would add
                the "class" attribute to the element's tag like so:
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 6.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />Note that you can apply the same class selector to
                multiple HTML elements, which can be useful for creating
                consistent styling across different parts of a webpage. To
                select elements with multiple classes, you can simply chain the
                class selectors together with no space.
              </p>

            <div id="item-2-2">
              <h5><br />2.2. Pseudo-classes on links</h5>
              <p>
                In CSS, pseudo-classes are used to style elements based on their
                state or position in the document tree. One of the most commonly
                used pseudo-classes is the :hover pseudo-class, which is used to
                style elements when the user hovers over them with the mouse.

                <br />When it comes to links, there are several pseudo-classes
                that can be used to style different states of the link. Here are
                some examples:
              </p>
              <p>
                :link: This pseudo-class is used to target links that have not
                yet been visited by the user. It is commonly used to set the
                default styles for links on a webpage.

                <br />:visited: This pseudo-class is used to target links that
                have already been visited by the user. It can be used to change
                the styling of links to indicate that they have already been
                clicked.

                <br />:hover: This pseudo-class is used to target links when the
                user hovers over them with the mouse. It is often used to add
                visual feedback to links, such as changing the color or adding
                an underline.

                <br />:active: This pseudo-class is used to target links when
                they are being clicked by the user. It is commonly used to add
                an extra visual effect, such as changing the link color or
                adding a background color.
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 8.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />In this example, we've set the default link color to blue
                and removed the underline with the :link pseudo-class. When a
                link is visited, it will turn purple due to the :visited
                pseudo-class. When the user hovers over a link, it will gain an
                underline due to the :hover pseudo-class. Finally, when the user
                clicks a link, it will turn red and gain an underline due to the
                :active pseudo-class.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="item-2-3">
              <h5>2.3. Bulled Lists</h5>
              <p>
                In CSS, you can use the list-style property to style bullet
                points in an unordered list. <br />Here's an example of how to
                do this:
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 9.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />In this example, we've defined styles for different types
                of bullet points using the list-style property. The disc value
                is the default style for bullet points. The square and circle
                values create different shapes for the bullet points.

                <br />The none value removes the bullet points altogether. This
                can be useful if you want to create a list that doesn't use
                bullet points.

                <br />
                Finally, the custom class removes the default bullet points and
                adds a custom bullet point using the :before pseudo-element. In
                this case, we've added a solid circle bullet point using the
                Unicode character "\2022". We've also adjusted the font size and
                margin to create a custom look for the bullet point.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="item-2-4">
              <h5>2.4. Borders and Backgrounds</h5>
              <p>
                The border property is used to set the border style, width, and
                color of an element. It can be set using the following syntax:
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 10.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />You can also set each individual property separately using
                the border-style, border-width, and border-color properties.
              </p>

              <p>
                The background property is used to set the background color or
                image of an element. It can be set using the following syntax:
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 11.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />You can also set a background image using the
                background-image property, and control how it repeats using the
                background-repeat property. The background-position property is
                used to set the position of the background image.
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 12.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <div id="item-2-5">
              <h5><br />2.5. Dimensions, Margin, Padding</h5>
              <p>
                In CSS, you can use the width, height, margin, and padding
                properties to control the dimensions of HTML elements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The width and height properties are used to set the dimensions
                of an element. They can be set using the following syntax:
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 13.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />The margin property is used to control the space outside
                an element. It can be set using the following syntax:
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 14.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />The padding property is used to control the space inside
                an element. It can be set using the following syntax:
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 15.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />Here's an example that combines all of these properties:

              <h4><br />3. Positioning the floats and the flow</h4>
            </div>
            <div id="Item 3-1">
              <h5>3.1. The Floats and the Flow</h5>
              <p>
                In CSS, the float property is used to control the positioning of
                elements within their container. When an element is floated, it
                is moved to the left or right of its containing element, and
                other elements flow around it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The float property can be set to either left or right, and it
                can be applied to block-level elements.
              </p>
              <p>
                When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow
                of the document. This can cause other elements to move around
                it, which can have unexpected effects on the layout of the page.
                To prevent this, you can use the clear property to ensure that
                no other elements are allowed to float next to the cleared
                element.
              </p>
              <p>
                The clear property can be set to left, right, both, or none.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the float and clear properties, there is also the
                concept of the document flow. The document flow refers to the
                order in which elements are displayed on the page. By default,
                elements are displayed in the order in which they appear in the
                HTML document.
              </p>
              <p>
                When elements are floated, they are taken out of the normal
                document flow. This can cause other elements to move around
                them, which can make it difficult to control the layout of the
                page. To ensure that elements are displayed in the correct
                order, you can use the display property to change the layout of
                the page.
              </p>
              <p>
                The display property can be set to block, inline, inline-block,
                table, and other values to control how elements are displayed.
                By changing the display value, you can control the layout of the
                page, even when elements are floated.

              <h5><br />3.2. The "Display" property for layout</h5>
              <p>
                In CSS, the display property is used to control the layout of
                HTML elements. It determines how an element should be displayed,
                and can take on several values, each of which affects the layout
                in a different way. Some of the most commonly used values for
                the display property are:
              </p>
              <p>
                block: This value causes an element to be displayed as a
                block-level element. Block-level elements take up the full width
                of their container and are stacked vertically. Examples of
                block-level elements include div, p, and h1-h6.

                <br />
                inline: This value causes an element to be displayed as an
                inline-level element. Inline-level elements take up only as much
                width as necessary and are stacked horizontally. Examples of
                inline-level elements include a, span, and img.

                <br />
                inline-block: This value causes an element to be displayed as an
                inline-level element, but with the dimensions and padding of a
                block-level element. This allows for elements to be positioned
                side-by-side while retaining the ability to set dimensions and
                padding. Examples of elements that can use inline-block include
                input, button, and select.

                <br />
                none: This value causes an element to be removed from the layout
                entirely. The element is not displayed and does not take up any
                space on the page. This is often used to hide elements in
                response to user actions.

                <br />
                flex: This value causes an element to become a flexible
                container that can be used to create a responsive layout.
                Elements within a flex container can be easily repositioned and
                resized based on the available space. This is often used to
                create layouts that adjust to different screen sizes.

                <br />Overall, the display property is a powerful tool for
                controlling the layout of HTML elements, and can be used in
                combination with other CSS properties to create responsive and
                visually appealing layouts.

              <h5>3.3. Relative, Absolute and Fixed position</h5>
              <p>
                In CSS, positioning properties are used to control the position
                of elements on a web page. The most commonly used positioning
                properties are relative, absolute, and fixed. <br />Here is an
                overview of each one:
              </p>
              <p>
                Relative Positioning: When an element is positioned relatively,
                it is positioned relative to its normal position in the flow of
                the document. This means that if you add a top or left property
                to the element, it will move from its original position by the
                amount specified in the property, but it will still take up
                space in the document flow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Absolute Positioning: When an element is positioned absolutely,
                it is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor
                element. If no positioned ancestor exists, it will be positioned
                relative to the body element. Absolute positioning takes the
                element out of the normal flow of the document, which means it
                will not take up any space in the document flow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fixed Positioning: When an element is positioned fixed, it is
                positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window). Fixed
                positioning also takes the element out of the normal flow of the
                document, which means it will not take up any space in the
                document flow. The element will stay in the same position even
                if the page is scrolled.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, the choice of which positioning property to use depends
                on the specific layout requirements of the web page. By using a
                combination of these positioning properties, designers can
                create complex and dynamic layouts that respond well to
                different devices and screen sizes.
