              <h5>1.1. General</h5>

              <p>
                A webpage is a single document or file that is displayed in a
                web browser when someone visits a specific URL. It contains
                various elements such as text, images, and links that are
                presented in a specific layout.<br />
                A website, on the other hand, is a collection of webpages that
                are linked together and accessed through a common domain name or
                URL. It can contain multiple webpages, including a homepage,
                about page, contact page, and other pages that provide
                information, services, or products.<br />
                A website can also have other elements such as a navigation
                menu, footer, header, and sidebars that help to organize the
                content and make it easier for users to navigate. Additionally,
                a website can contain interactive elements such as forms,
                videos, and animations. <br />In summary, a webpage is a single
                document that is displayed in a web browser, while a website is
                a collection of webpages that are linked together and accessed
                through a common domain name or URL.

              <h5>1.2. Syntax: tags, elements, attributes</h5>
              <p>
                In HTML, tags, elements, and attributes are used to create and
                define the structure and content of a webpage.<br />

                <br />Tags: Tags are HTML elements that are used to define the
                structure of the webpage. They are enclosed in angle brackets
                (&lt;&gt;) and can be either opening tags or closing tags.
                Opening tags are used to start an HTML element, while closing
                tags are used to end it.<br />

                <br />Elements: Elements are made up of tags, content, and
                attributes. They define the structure and content of a webpage.
                For example, the HTML element &lt;h1&gt; defines a heading
                element, and the content between the opening and closing tags is
                the text that appears as the heading on the webpage.<br />

                <br />Attributes: Attributes provide additional information
                about an HTML element. They are added to the opening tag of an
                element and are made up of a name and a value. For example, the
                "src" attribute in the &lt;img&gt; element is used to specify
                the URL of the image file to be displayed on the webpage.

                <br /><br />
                Here is an example of how tags, elements, and attributes are
                used in HTML:
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot1.png" alt="exp1" />
              <p>
                <br />In this example, the &lt;html&gt; element is the root
                element, and contains the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;
                elements. The &lt;head&gt; element contains metadata about the
                webpage, including the title. The &lt;body&gt; element contains
                the visible content of the webpage, including a heading,
                paragraph, image, and link. The &lt;img&gt; element has an "src"
                attribute that specifies the URL of the image file to be
                displayed, and an "alt" attribute that provides alternative text
                in case the image cannot be displayed. The &lt;a&gt; element has
                an "href" attribute that specifies the URL of the webpage to be
                linked to.
              </p>

              <h5>1.3. Content structuring elements</h5>
              <p>
                HTML provides several content structuring elements that are used
                to create a well-organized and semantically meaningful webpage.
                These elements help to define the structure of the content and
                provide information about its meaning, making it easier for
                search engines, screen readers, and other assistive technologies
                to interpret the content. Some of the most commonly used content
                structuring elements in HTML include:
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;header&gt; element is used to define the top section of
                a webpage, which typically includes a logo, navigation menu, and
                other elements that are repeated across multiple pages of the
                website.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;nav&gt; element is used to define a section of a webpage
                that contains links to other pages on the website or to external
                websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;main&gt; element is used to define the main content of a
                webpage, which typically includes the primary content of the
                page.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;section&gt; element is used to define a section of a
                webpage that contains related content, such as a group of
                articles or a list of products.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;article&gt; element is used to define a standalone piece
                of content that can be read independently, such as a news
                article, blog post, or product review.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;aside&gt; element is used to define a section of a
                webpage that contains content that is related to the main
                content, but is not essential to the overall meaning of the page
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;footer&gt; element is used to define the bottom section
                of a webpage, which typically includes copyright information,
                contact information, and other elements that are repeated across
                multiple pages of the website.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using these content structuring elements in HTML, you can
                create a well-organized and semantically meaningful webpage that
                is easy to navigate and understand.

              <h5>2.1. Text "formatting" elements</h5>
              <p>
                HTML provides several text formatting elements that allow you to
                change the appearance of text on a webpage. These elements are
                used to add emphasis, headings, lists, and other formatting to
                the text content. Here are some of the most commonly used text
                formatting elements in HTML:
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; elements are used to define headings
                of varying sizes and importance, with &lt;h1&gt; being the
                largest and most important. Headings provide a visual hierarchy
                to the content and help users to quickly identify the main
                sections of the page.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;p&gt; element is used to define paragraphs of text. It
                is the most common text element in HTML.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; elements are used to add
                emphasis to text. &lt;strong&gt; is used to indicate important
                text that should be bolded, while &lt;em&gt; is used to indicate
                emphasized text that should be italicized.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;u&gt;, &lt;s&gt;, and &lt;del&gt; elements are used to
                underline, strike through, and add a line through text,
                respectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;blockquote&gt; element is used to quote text from
                another source. It is often used to format longer quotes and
                distinguish them from the rest of the text.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; elements are used to create
                unordered and ordered lists, respectively. Items in an unordered
                list are preceded by bullet points, while items in an ordered
                list are numbered.
              </p>
              <p>
                The &lt;br&gt; element is used to create a line break, while the
                &lt;hr&gt; element is used to create a horizontal line that can
                be used to separate sections of content.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using these text formatting elements in HTML, you can create
                a webpage that is easy to read and visually appealing. However,
                it's important to use text formatting elements appropriately and
                sparingly, as overuse can make the content difficult to read and
                understand.

            <div id="item-2-2">
              <h5>2.2. Links</h5>
              <p>
                Links are an important feature of HTML that allow you to create
                hyperlinks to other webpages, documents, or resources on the
                internet. They allow users to navigate between webpages and
                access additional content related to the current webpage.

                <br />To create a link in an HTML document, you need to use the
                &lt;a&gt; element, which stands for "anchor." The &lt;a&gt;
                element requires a minimum of two attributes: href and text.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are several other attributes that you can use with the
                &lt;a&gt; element to control the behavior and appearance of the
                link. Some common attributes include:
              </p>
              <p>
                target: Specifies where the linked document should open (e.g.,
                in a new window or tab). title: Specifies a tooltip text that
                appears when the user hovers over the link. rel: Specifies the
                relationship between the current document and the linked
                document (e.g., whether it is a bookmark or a reference).
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 2.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />In this example, the target attribute is set to _blank,
                which tells the browser to open the linked document in a new
                window or tab. The title attribute specifies a tooltip that
                appears when the user hovers over the link.

                <br />Links can also be used to create internal links within the
                same webpage or website. To create an internal link, you need to
                specify the target location using a URL fragment identifier,
                which is a section of the URL that begins with a # symbol
                followed by an anchor name or ID.
              </p>
              <img src="../image/Screenshot 3.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                <br />In this example, the href attribute points to the ID of
                the h2 element that defines Section 2, which is specified using
                the id attribute. When the user clicks on the link, the browser
                will scroll down to the section of the page that contains the
                target element.

                <br /><br />Overall, links are an essential element of HTML that
                allow you to create a navigable and interconnected web of
                information.

                more &lt;li&gt; (list item) elements. Unordered lists display
                list items with bullet points, while ordered lists display them
                with numbered or lettered labels. List items can also contain
                other HTML elements such as text, images, or links.

                which contains one or more &lt;tr&gt; (table row) elements. Each
                table row contains one or more &lt;td&gt; (table data) elements
                that represent individual cells within the table. Tables can
                also have header cells using the &lt;th&gt; (table header)
                element, which are typically displayed in bold and centered.
                Table cells can contain any type of content, including text,
                images, links, or other HTML elements. Additionally, tables can
                be styled using CSS to control their appearance and layout.

              <h5>3.3. Forms</h5>
              <p>
                In HTML, forms are created using the &lt;form&gt; element, which
                contains various types of input fields that allow users to
                submit data to a web server. Input fields can include text
                fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, drop-down menus, and buttons.
                Each input field is created using a specific type of 'input'
                element, with additional attributes used to control its behavior
                and appearance. When a user submits a form, the data is
                typically sent to a web server using the HTTP POST or GET
                method, where it can be processed and stored. Forms can also be
                styled using CSS to control their appearance and layout.

                This is just a basic overview, but it should provide you with a
                solid foundation in HTML. Good luck with your studies!
